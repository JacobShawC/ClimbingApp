# Development of a cloud based web application for running climbing competitions
This is the repository for my Climbing App created as part of my Open Univesity degree's final project and is available at https://ClimbingScores.co.uk/

ClimbingScores.co.uk is a cloud based web app that helps people run climbing competitions. Using the app people can manage and sign up for  various climbing competitions.

ClimbingScores was developed using Amazon Web Services and Javascript.
The report on the development of the app can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uamDZQuOTYKOEaFLjbP08_cXO5DjEBn4xAHfFiU47V4/edit?usp=sharing).
