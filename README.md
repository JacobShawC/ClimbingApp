# Development of a cloud based web application for running climbing competitions
This is the repository for my Climbing App created as part of my Open Univesity degree's final project. It is a cloud based web app that helps people run climbing competitions. Using the app people can sign up and enter scores for various competitions.

It was developed using Amazon Web Services and Javascript. Available at https://ClimbingScores.co.uk/

The report on the development of the app can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uamDZQuOTYKOEaFLjbP08_cXO5DjEBn4xAHfFiU47V4/edit?usp=sharing
